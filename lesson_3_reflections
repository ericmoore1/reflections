When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote reository when I am not at my home computer
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? I would rather pull changes manually so that can choose what is pulled
